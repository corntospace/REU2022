# REU2022
This is a repository for testing P4 and SDN network configurations as a part of the Consumer Networking REU at the University of Missouri - Columbia.
Will be referencing the repository: https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials.git for setting up network configurations, but will be implementing
custom protocols onto the switches for our experiments.
